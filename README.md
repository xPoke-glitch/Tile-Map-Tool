# Tile Map Tool
[![Made with Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Unity-57b9d3.svg?style=flat&logo=unity)](https://www.unity.com)

This is my first project on creating a **custom editor tool** for Unity.
The tool is a simple level editor for tile based maps.

## The Tool

The tool is a level editor for tile based maps.

There is a grid that displays the current grid in the scene and a square pointer that you can move.
The pointer displays where you will place the tile in the grid. 

You can choose which Tile to place from the dropdown menu, each tile has a different color grid.

In order to draw or remove a tile you press respectively the draw or remove button.

You can also add a new tile by name (the tile prefab must be in the Assets/Prefabs folder)

Note: All the changes (except for new tiles added, feature not developed yet for a matter of time) are saved when the Tool or Unity are closed
